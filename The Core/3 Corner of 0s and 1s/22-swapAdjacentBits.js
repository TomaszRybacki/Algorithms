/*
You're given an arbitrary 32-bit integer n.
Take its binary representation, split bits into it in pairs
(bit number 0 and 1, bit number 2 and 3, etc.) and swap bits in each pair.
Then return the result as a decimal number.

Example

For n = 13, the output should be
swapAdjacentBits(n) = 14.

13 = 1101 ~> {11}{01} ~> 1110 = 14.

For n = 74, the output should be
swapAdjacentBits(n) = 133.

74 = 01001010 ~> {01}{00}{10}{10} ~> 10000101 = 133.
Note the preceding zero written in front of the initial number:
since both numbers are 32-bit integers, they have 32 bits in their
binary representation. The preceding zeros in other cases don't matter,
so they are omitted. Here, however, it does make a difference.
